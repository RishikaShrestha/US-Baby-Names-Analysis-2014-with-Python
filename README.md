# US-Baby-Names-Analysis-2014-with-Python

## Project Overview

This project is part of my Data Analytics course on Udemy, where I analyse the US Baby Names dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary objective is to apply data manipulation techniques in Python to determine the most popular baby names in the US for the year 2014.


## Dataset

The dataset consists of 5 columns and 1,048,550 rows.
Imported and analysed using Jupyter Notebook and the pandas library.

## Data Analysis Steps

To find the most popular baby names in 2014, the following steps were performed:

### Filtering: 
Extracting data for the year 2014.
### Sorting: 
Arranging names in descending order based on count.
### Top 5 Common Names: 
Retrieving the first five rows to identify the most popular names.

## Results
After applying these transformations, the most popular US baby names in 2014 were:

Emma, Olivia, Noah, Sophia, and Liam
